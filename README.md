# 📋Project 3-Classic Arcade Game Project

![Alt text](images/overview.png?raw=true)

This is my third project from Udacity Front End Nano Degree. It is an assessment after learning Object Oriented Javascript. In this project, the starter pack comes with the HTML canvas resources file and initial game engine for image rendering. The rest of the rules, characters, and images are free to design as long as they fulfill the challenge checklist.

## 💡 How to play

My inspiration comes from the Pixar Movie - Monster Inc. The main rule of the game is:

1. Sully (the blue monster) needs to save Boo (the purple kid) and reaches the Monster Inc (the blue M icons).
2. Mike (the green monster) would appear randomly to distract Sully from reaching the goal.
3. If Mike touches Sully, it will count 1 death and Sully has to restart from the original position.
4. Sully cannot win the game without saving all the Boos even he reaches the Monster Inc.
5. After Sully wins the game, it will have a winner message in the modal with the death count.
